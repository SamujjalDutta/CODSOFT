# Task 1 - Rule-Based Chatbot

# Overview

This is a simple Python-based chatbot created for the CodSoft AI Internship. The bot responds to specific user inputs using predefined answers stored in a dictionary. It also includes a typing effect to make the conversation feel more natural.

# Project Context

The chatbot is designed to assist students with greetings, study tips, motivational quotes, and general questions like who created it or its name.

This chatbot was created as Task 1 of the CodSoft AI Internship Program. The goal was to build a rule-based chatbot using Python that could simulate basic human-like interaction through predefined responses.

The bot, named StudentBot, is designed specifically to assist students by:

- Greeting users
- Offering motivational quotes
- Providing study tips (e.g., Pomodoro technique)
- Responding to common questions like "who made you" or "your name"

The chatbot uses a dictionary-based logic to match user inputs and includes a typing effect to make the interaction feel more realistic. It was built without using any external libraries, relying only on Python's built-in modules (time and random).

This project demonstrates:

- Understanding of Python fundamentals
- Use of conditionals, loops, and functions
- Clean input handling and user experience focus
- Original implementation and personal branding

# Features

- Answers basic greetings and questions
- Provides a study tip and motivational quotes
- Handles unknown inputs with a default message
- Ends the conversation when the user types "bye"
- Simulates typing for a more engaging chat experience
