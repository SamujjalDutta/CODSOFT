# Task 2 - Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

# Overview

This is a Python-based terminal game developed as part of the CodSoft AI Internship. It allows a human player to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent. The game offers two difficulty levels: Easy (random AI) and Hard (Minimax AI). It uses colored terminal output for better readability and interaction.

# Project Context

The project was built for Task 2 of the CodSoft AI Internship Program with the goal of implementing basic artificial intelligence in a classic game environment. The game helps demonstrate how AI can make optimal decisions using the Minimax algorithm.

In this project:

- The player always plays as 'X'
- The AI (O) can be set to Easy (random moves) or Hard (perfect AI using Minimax)
- The game displays move history, supports replay, and keeps track of scores
- Terminal output is enhanced using colors (blue for X, red for O)

This project showcases:

- Understanding of Python logic and game loops
- Implementation of recursive algorithms (Minimax)
- Clean user interaction via the console
- Efficient handling of user inputs and board state

# Features

- Play against the AI in Easy or Hard mode
- Smart AI that never loses in Hard mode
- Move history shown after each round
- Score tracking and replay functionality
- Colored display using `colorama` for better UI
